Iâ€™m an electronics engineering graduate from Pulchowk Campus, IOE, Nepal. I work with [Dr. Suresh Manandhar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EJh5zWwAAAAJ&hl=en) as a research assistant at [Wiseyak](https://wiseyak.com/). I am currently doing research on developing low cost AI solutions for Cervical Cancer.

I am interested in domain combining Robotics and AI. My research focuses on improving the performance of autonomous systems by briding the gaps between hardware, software and control technologies. I love to work on the field of machine intelligence which leverages RL techniques with advanced control algorithms to improve their efficiency and operational characteristics.

Research Interests: Robotics, Medical Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Multimodal Learning, Control System
